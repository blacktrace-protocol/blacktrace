1. The Hook: What is BlackTrace? (The Missing Layer)

BlackTrace is the decentralized, zero-knowledge OTC coordination protocol built on Zcash. We enable institutions to execute massive, large-volume ZEC trades—worth millions—without market impact, information leakage, or counterparty risk.
Simply put: We are the missing application layer that transforms Zcash from a private asset into an institutional trading instrument.

2. The Pain: The Impossible Trilemma

Institutional traders (hedge funds, market makers) of Zcash face an impossible trade-off when moving large size: They can only pick one of these three:
Privacy (hiding their position).
Guaranteed Settlement (no counterparty risk).
Efficient Price Discovery (finding the best price quickly).
The Story of Pain: Today, calling an OTC desk leaks your 50,000 ZEC sell order. Desks front-run you or coordinate to lower the bid, costing you $1M+ on a $23M trade. On top of that, manual, 48-hour settlements expose you to billions in counterparty default risk, as seen in the Genesis bankruptcy.
Zcash provides transaction privacy, but provides zero infrastructure to find a counterparty safely. This is a broken system.

3. The Solution: Coordination Built on ZK

BlackTrace solves the institutional trilemma by building a trustless coordination layer on top of Zcash's Orchard privacy features.



4. The Moat: Why BlackTrace Wins

Zero Risk, 96x Faster: We eliminate billions in counterparty exposure and reduce settlement time from 48 hours to 30 minutes.
First & Only ZK-Attested Protocol: No other system combines zero-knowledge discovery with atomic settlement on a privacy L1. This can't be replicated on Ethereum or Bitcoin without massive trade-offs.
Native L1 Privacy: Settlement occurs directly in Zcash’s Orchard shielded pool. No bridges, no L2 operators, no intermediary risk—only trust in math.
We are transforming the risky, expensive, 48-hour OTC negotiation into a trustless, 30-minute cryptographic exchange.

BlackTrace is the First & Only ZK-Attested OTC Coordination Protocol on a privacy-preserving L1
5. Call to Action

The time for institutional privacy is now. We are technically ready to prove our concept.
